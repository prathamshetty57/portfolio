{{ }}- this in html gives flask the idea that the content inside the curly bracket is expression
e.g.- {{4+5}} this will print 9 on webpage and not 4+5 
for this the flask uses the jinja template engine under the hood. this helps in making the page more dynamic.
this is used wth url parameter.

'url for' module
this helps to print the url of 
print(url_for('static', filename='bolt.ico')) this will give the url for the file

commands to export the python file for flask app and to on the debug mode
$env:FLASK_APP = "hello"
> flask run

$env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
> flask run

MIME type(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
Browsers use the MIME type, not the file extension, to determine how to process a URL, so it's important that web servers send the correct MIME type in the response's Content-Type header. If this is not correctly configured, browsers are likely to misinterpret the contents of files, sites will not work correctly, and downloaded files may be mishandled.
